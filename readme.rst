Welcome

Readme file for the purpose of following the git tutorial provided in Chapter 15 of Effective Computation in Physics.

Don't forget there is a git tutorial that may be accessed via the man pages.

The dummy project for the tutorial is on parity violations in the standard model.

At this point save this readme and make another commit.

This is Dr. Nu's read me ....


An add adds the file to the stage... and a commit is a snapshot.

In the context of quantum physics, parity is a type of symmetric relation.
Now save and commit.

Now save and try git diff before committing.

Add some more text for the pupose of examining the results of the git checkout command
The line of text is gone --> git revert worked correctly.
